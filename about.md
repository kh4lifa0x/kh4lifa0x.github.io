I'm a **Threat Researcher** and **DFIR Engineer** specializing in infrastructure adversary hunting and forensic investigations. I have a strong passion for malware analysis and uncovering advanced threat actor techniques.

On this site, you'll find my technical blogs, threat research, and deep-dive investigations into real-world attacks.
